# Project Document



## Your final outcome:
- You will build a *dynamic* **web application** using the CS tools you learned so far!


## Project Plan:
In this challenge, you are assigned a [Company] who came to you with a problem statement. Brainstorm ways to solve the problem, and integrate your CS skills in the solution!  


## Official Requirements:
Final Outcome:
- User Interactivity/Friendliness 
- Uses Flask (Routing & Forms)
- Databases implemented (2 functions of C(reate) R(ead) U(pdate) D(elete))


### Bonus:
- APIs



## Why should you care?
You learned about Front-end (HTML, CSS and JS) and Back-end (Python, Flask and Firebase). Now it’s time to put all of this knowledge combined together to the test!  
The best way to practice and solidify all of these new concept in programming is to actually implement it, so this project gives you a chance to make practical use of what you’ve learned.


## Brainstorming:  
1. Brainstorm ways you can use a web application to solve your company's challenge.
- Can be on paper & pen or a tool of your choice. *Make sure to save your documentation somewhere safe as you are encouraged to submit it!*

## Storyboarding & Wireframing:
1. Draw the storyboards and wireframe of your different pages!  
- Can be on paper & pen or a wireframing tool of your choice (such as [NinjaMock](https://ninjamock.com/)).
- For getting a color scheme, here's a [useful website](https://coolors.co/)  
- Wireframe example:

## Building/Workflow:
1. Brainstorming
2. Writing down your plan *(must)*, Storyboarding & Wireframing *must)* + Choosing a color scheme *(optional)*
3. Implementation (Coding + building everything together)
